# Portfolio Comparisons

Now that we have discussed some of the core concepts in investing let's take a moment to look back at some of the themes we've covered so far with regards to making comparisons across potential investments.

## Instructions

In this unit, we have covered Modern Portfolio Theory along with the Time Value of Money. In prior sections, we also discussed Sharpe Ratios, Sortino Ratios, Information Ratios, Volatility, and the CAPM model.

What does each of these pieces of information tell you about a portfolio that you may want to invest in? How can you use them to compare across multiple portfolios? Are there any metrics that you would give more or less weight to? How might you use these pieces of information to develop investment strategies?

Each investor has different goals. A young investor has the time to invest aggressively because over time that youthful investor has the luxury of time to recover any loss. An older investor may require a more stable and frequent return, which may permit for a lower return in exchange for less volatility. Therefore, while every measure of a portfolios "success" may utilize different ratios, it is the consumers goals that dictate success.
