We quantify that benefit from interest rates or the expected percentage return o
n capital. Put it this way: Would you rather have $10,000 now, or $10,010 a year
 from now? The latter option doesn't sound very appealing, does it? Indeed, that
's only one-tenth of a percent of return. That doesn't even beat inflation--you'
d effectively be losing money! But how about this: $10,000 now, or $15,000 in a 
year? A 50% annual return sounds pretty appealing.

These rates, 0.10%, and 50%--are interest rates or rates of return. In a competi
tive market, what goes into determining a particular interest rate ultimately de
pends on the alternative options the borrower and lender both have. If there's a
 lot of money looking to be parked somewhere, and no one really interested in bo
rrowing, interest rates will drop. If people expect inflation to be really high,
 they'll only lend their money out if the interest rate is high enough to compen
sate them for that.

There's a way to compare money today versus money tomorrow. Money today, or in t
he present, is called **Present Value**, or PV. **Money tomorrow**, or in the fu
ture, is called Future Value, or FV. The two are linked by the expected return e
ach time period. For example, to find out what $10,000 is worth 5 years from now
, assuming a 10% annual return and assuming that profits are reinvested annually
, we use this formula:
