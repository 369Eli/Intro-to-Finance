# Calculating TVM

In order to build some familiarity with the TVM equation, let's run through a quick practice problem

## Instructions

You are presented three opportunities for investment:

  - An investment that will be worth $20,000 after 2 years, compounding semi-annually at 5% interest

  - An investment that will be worth $15,000 after 1 year, compounding only once at 4% interest

  - An investment that will be worth $18,000 after 1 year, compounding semi-annually at 8% interest

Which investment values your present cash the highest? Which one seems riskiest? Which would you want to invest in? (Hint: This question does not have a straightforward answer)

With out knowing the initial seed deposit to this investment portfolio it is difficult to gage what percentage of and speed of growth is being experienced in these portfolio situations. As a conservative investor and if the seed deposit for this investment portfolio was $1000 then I would argue that the best investment value would be $18,0000 semi-annually at 8% interest.
