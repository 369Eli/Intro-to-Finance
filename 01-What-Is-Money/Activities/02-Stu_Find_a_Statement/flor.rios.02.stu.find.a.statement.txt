# Flor Rios Finds a Statement

## Instructions
Using EDGAR or a Google search, try to find a copy of a company's 10K or 10Q. Identify the three major statements within it. Are there any line-items that you haven't heard of? What are additional items contained in an official document that we haven't covered here?

	Answer: KEY TAKEAWAYS
SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of financial performance submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Form 10-Q contains financial statements, management discussion and analysis, disclosures, and internal controls for the previous quarter.

Companies must file their 10-Qs 40 or 45 days after the end of their quarters, depending on the size of their public float.

A snapshot of the company's financial position, Form 10-Q provides investors with information they can compare to previous periods and use to evaluate the outlook for the stock's performance.

Form 10-Q is not an audited statement, unlike the annual Form 10-K companies are also required to file.
