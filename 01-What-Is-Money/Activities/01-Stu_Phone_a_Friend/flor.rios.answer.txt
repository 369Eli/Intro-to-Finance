What is Money?

# Instructions 
	Ask folks what they think money is.

## Answers 
	Money is cash. When you work "they" give you money and then you can spend it. 
	
# Observations 
	Folks who have never understood what an appreciating asset is do not understand 
	that money can be anything of value. It includes commodities like gold, silver, oil, and also 	
	stocks and bonds. Real Estate and other such assets are not included in the idea of what is 			
	money.
